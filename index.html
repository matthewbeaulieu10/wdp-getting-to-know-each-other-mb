        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm a software engineering major, 
            hence why I'm taking this course. 
            Sometimes I feel out of place in this major because it 
            seems like everyone either knows more than I do, or they
            just like it a lot more. I think computer science is cool,
            and I enjoy doing coding projects, but I'm not into it like
            other students here. 
            I'm also on the soccer team, 
            I'm a part of a couple bible studies on campus, and I like to be alone. I love movies, 
            books, and eating at the cafe for like 6 hours everyday. I'm 
            a part of two families, birth and adopted, so I have four
            parents, two sisters and two brothers. Both families live in 
            South Elgin, Illinois.

            <h4>My Favorite Hobby:</h4>
            <p>
                Over the last year, I've made reading a huge priority and habit. 
                Every morning I try to spend at least a half hour reading the Bible, 
                it grounds me and helps me learn more about God. It is one
                of my favorite things to do. Recently I've just started to pick up 
                other books as well. I just finished Fahrenheit 451 and started the
                Martian today. I'd say my favorite book is called the Gates of Fire 
                by Steven Pressfield, and it tells the story of a Spartan slave during
                the battle of the 300 at Thermopylae. I'm not a big history guy, but 
                sheeeeesh what a book.

        <div id="fun">
            <p>a quick fun fact about me is that my friends always
                make fun of me for carrying around my bible... and 
                they speculate whether or not I take it with me to 
                the toilet...
